# Internal incident classification and response workflow

## Control statement

Use the CSG risk framework to prepare internal incident classification, escalation, communication ownership, post-incident analysis, and recurrence-prevention tracking. Do not present its internal response times as a customer's contractual SLA/SLT. The source is marked approved but its next review date has passed, so current applicability requires human confirmation.

## Scope

- Applies to internal classification of operational/security incidents and major risks.
- Applies to routing an incident to leadership, technical, customer-response, and security owners.
- Does not replace the customer's SLA, SOW, COC live process, or security-incident contractual notice deadline.

## Required behavior

1. Determine affected customers, systems, scope, and severity from live evidence.
2. Immediately report a major risk through the current human escalation chain.
3. Record initial classification, assigned response team, recovery evidence, customer-communication owner, post-incident analysis, and prevention action.
4. Keep technical response, customer communication, and security response ownership distinct.
5. Reconcile this internal workflow with `POLICY-SUPPORT-001` and `POLICY-INCIDENT-001` before quoting any customer-facing time.

## Prohibited behavior

- Treating internal Critical/High/Medium/Low times as a customer contractual commitment
- Sending customer incident communication from an agent session
- Triggering recovery or infrastructure changes without a human-controlled process
- Using the overdue Raw roster as current contact information

## Exceptions and escalation

- Customer contract/SLA controls customer-facing commitments.
- The current COC/on-call process controls live routing after human verification.
- Security incidents may have a separate contractual or legal notification deadline.

## Evidence

- `SRC-CSG-RISK-001:381-416` — governance assigns risk, finance, security, and team roles; major risks are reported immediately and tracked through mitigation/result reporting.
- `SRC-CSG-RISK-001:421-430` — the source defines internal Critical/High/Medium/Low impact and response/escalation levels.
- `SRC-CSG-RISK-001:432-441` — workflow covers immediate detection/reporting, 15-minute classification, 30-minute team assembly, recovery, ongoing customer communication, 24-hour analysis, and one-week prevention action.
- `SRC-CSG-RISK-001:443-450` — incident, technical, customer-response, and security roles are separated.
- `SRC-CSG-RISK-001:455-458` — version 1.0, updated 2026-02-12, review due 2026-05-12, marked approved by Saltware CSG Leadership.

## Change history

- 2026-08-24 — Drafted; source review is overdue and current incident ownership requires human confirmation.
